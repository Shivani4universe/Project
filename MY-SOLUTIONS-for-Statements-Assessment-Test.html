Use for, .split(), and if to create a Statement that will print out words that start with 's':

st = 'Print only the words that start with s in this sentence'

</p>
<p>
Use range() to print all the even numbers from 0 to 10.
<!-- Python code here-->

for num in range(0, 11):
    print(num)

</p>
<p>
Use a List Comprehension to create a list of all numbers between 1 and 50 that are divisible by 3.

<!-- for loop -->
for num in range(1, 51):
    if num%3 == 0:
       print(num)
       
<!-- list comprehension -->
mylist = [num for num in range(1, 51) if num%3 == 0]
</p>
<p>
Go through the string below and if the length of a word is even print "even!"
<!--for loop -->
st = 'Print every word in this sentence that has an even number of letters'
st.split()

for words in st.split():
    if len(words)%2 == 0:
       print(words)
<!--list comprehension-->

st = 'Print every word in this sentence that has an even number of letters'
st.split()

mylist = [words in words for st.split() if len(words)%2 == 0]
>>mylist
>>['word', 'in', 'this', 'sentence', 'that', 'an', 'even', 'number', 'of']

<p>
Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100. 
But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number, 
and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

for num in range(1, 101):
    if num % 15 == 0:
        print('FizzBuzz')
    elif num % 3 == 0:
        print('Fizz')
    elif num % 5 == 0:
        print('Buzz')
    else:
        print(num)

Use List Comprehension to create a list of the first letters of every word in the string below:

st = 'Create a list of the first letters of every word in this string'
